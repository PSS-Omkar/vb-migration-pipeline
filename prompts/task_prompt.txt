Convert the following Visual Basic code to {{TARGET_LANG}}.

Follow these steps:
1. Analyze the VB code structure and identify all classes, methods, and dependencies.
2. Plan the conversion by mapping VB constructs to {{TARGET_LANG}} equivalents.
3. Generate the converted code, preserving all business logic.
4. Review the output for syntax errors and logical consistency.

SOURCE CODE:
```vb
{{SOURCE_CODE}}
```

OUTPUT:
Provide the converted {{TARGET_LANG}} code in a single markdown code block. Do not include any explanatory text outside the code block.
